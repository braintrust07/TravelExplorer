<h3>Nusa Penida</h3>
<p>Nusa Penida (Balinese: ᬦᬸᬲᬧᭂᬦᬶᬤ, romanized: nusa penida) is an island located near the southeastern Indonesian island of Bali, which forms a district of the same name in Klungkung Regency. The Badung Strait separates the island and Bali. The interior of Nusa Penida is hilly with a maximum altitude of 524 metres, and the climate is drier than Bali. Like Bali, it is a major tourist destination.
Nusa Penida, together with neighbouring Lembongan and Ceningan Islands, forms a bird sanctuary.The island communities have used traditional Balinese village regulations to create the sanctuary. The idea of a sanctuary came from the Friends of the National Parks Foundation (FNPF)</p>

<h3>Nusa Lembongan</h3>
<p>Nusa Lembongan is an island located southeast of Bali, Indonesia. It is part of a group of three islands that make up the Nusa Penida district, of which it is the most famous of the three islands of Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan - known together as the "Nusa Islands".[1] This island group, in turn, is part of the Lesser Sunda Islands.
Marine conservation is considered extremely important to sustaining future levels of tourism on the island[8] and in February 2009, a local NGO from Nusa Lembongan, facilitated by The Nature Conservancy Coral Triangle Center, opened a community centre on Nusa Lembongan. The waters around Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida have at least 247 species of coral and 562 species of reef fish.</p>

Each of the sea temples was established within eyesight of the next.
